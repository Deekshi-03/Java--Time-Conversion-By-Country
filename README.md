# Java--Time-Conversion-By-Country

This project is to convert the local time zone into the country zone time which is provided by the user as an input. This project uses Date and Time library in Java.
This is my first project in Code clause Internship.

To run the program in VS Code, first download the Java VS Code Extension by Microsoft. And then run using F5, or navigating to the run button by selecting the program file. Thank you!
